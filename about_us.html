    <h2>About Our Server</h2>
    <p>
      Farleigh County Roleplay Community (FCRC) was created to redefine what a high-quality ER:LC experience can be. 
      Our server is built around the idea that roleplay should be immersive, structured, and rewarding, while still providing 
      room for creativity and freedom. We aim to give players a professional yet enjoyable environment where every session feels unique 
      and every interaction leaves a lasting impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      What sets FCRC apart is its dedication to detail. With a committed staff team, daily server start-ups, and resources designed 
      to elevate gameplay, we place emphasis on both realism and fun. Whether you are a long-time roleplayer or a newcomer just beginning 
      your journey, FCRC offers a platform where you can learn, grow, and contribute to a thriving roleplay ecosystem.

    <h2>About Our Fictional County</h2>
    <p>
      Farleigh County is a fictional Canadian-inspired region, located in the southeastern corner of Saskatchewan. 
      The county’s design is rooted in the layout of the ER:LC map, but it has been reimagined to provide a realistic yet 
      flexible environment for roleplay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landscape reflects a balance of rural and urban life: sprawling highways that cut through farmlands and open plains, 
      small towns full of character, and urban centers that serve as the county’s beating heart. Natural features such as forests, 
      lakes, and hills make the setting diverse and immersive for scenarios of all types.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farleigh County is more than just a map; it is the foundation of our community’s identity and a living space where 
      imagination meets realism.
